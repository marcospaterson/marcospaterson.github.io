## Market Impact Analysis

### Potential Market Movers

**Macro Risks:**
- **US PCE Inflation**: Higher-than-expected July PCE or upward GDP revision could reduce Federal Reserve rate cut expectations
- **Brazil Inflation**: IPCA-15 and CAGED employment data will influence Selic rate expectations
- **European Inflation**: Flash CPI readings will feed into ECB monetary policy stance
- **Asia/EM Data**: Japan industrial production, India GDP, and Canada GDP provide cross-asset trading signals

**Earnings Focus:**
- **NVIDIA (Wednesday after market close)**: Q2 FY26 results will be the week's most critical earnings event, with significant implications for AI sector sentiment and broader technology market direction
- **Retail Sector**: Guidance from major retailers will indicate consumer spending trends
- **Technology/Software**: Performance and outlook from HPQ, MongoDB, Snowflake, Marvell, and SentinelOne could impact broader tech sentiment alongside NVIDIA

### Key Themes to Watch

1. **NVIDIA Earnings Impact**: Q2 FY26 results could significantly move AI/semiconductor sector and broader technology indices
2. **Federal Reserve Policy Path**: Economic data strength versus dovish expectations
3. **Global Inflation Trends**: Divergence or convergence in major economies
4. **Consumer Health**: Retail earnings and spending data alignment
5. **Emerging Market Dynamics**: Brazil's economic trajectory and policy response

This economic calendar provides essential timing for traders, investors, and analysts monitoring global economic developments and market-moving events throughout the week.
