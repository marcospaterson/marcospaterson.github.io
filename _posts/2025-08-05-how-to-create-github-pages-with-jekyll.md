# How to Create a GitHub Pages Site with Jekyll: A Step-by-Step Guide

Welcome to my very first blog post! In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the exact process I used to create this GitHub Pages site with Jekyll. This is a perfect solution for developers who want to showcase their projects and share knowledge through blogging, all for free using GitHub's hosting.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- A fully functional GitHub Pages site
- A blog structure for writing posts
- A professional landing page
- A contact page for networking
- The knowledge to customize and expand your site

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Basic knowledge of Markdown
- A text editor (VS Code recommended)

## Step 1: Create Your GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `yourusername.github.io` (replace with your actual GitHub username)
3. Make sure it's public
4. Initialize with a README if desired
5. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```



```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

This is Jekyll's main configuration file:


  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
  gem "jekyll-sitemap"
end
```
```yaml
# Site settings
title: Your Name
email: your-email@example.com
description: >-
  Your site description here. This will appear in search results
  and social media previews.
baseurl: ""
url: "https://yourusername.github.io"

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
highlighter: rouge
theme: minima
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-sitemap

# Collections
collections:
  posts:
    output: true
    permalink: /blog/:year/:month/:day/:title/
```

### The `Gemfile`

This specifies the Ruby gems (packages) your site needs:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3.0"
gem "minima", "~> 2.5"

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
  gem "jekyll-sitemap"
end
```

## Step 3: Create Your Pages

### Landing Page (`index.md`)

Your homepage should welcome visitors and explain what they'll find:

```markdown
---
layout: default
---

<div class="home">
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>Welcome to My Development Journey</h1>
    <p>Description of your site and what visitors will find here.</p>
  </section>
  
  <!-- Add sections for recent posts, project highlights, etc. -->
</div>
```

### Blog Page (`blog.md`)

A dedicated page to list all your blog posts:

```markdown
---
layout: page
title: Blog
permalink: /blog/
---

<div class="blog-page">
  <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <article class="post-preview">
      <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
      <p class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}</p>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">Read more â†’</a>
    </article>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

### Contact Page (`contact.md`)

Essential for networking and job opportunities:

```markdown
---
layout: page
title: Contact
permalink: /contact/
---

# Let's Connect

Information about how people can reach you, including:
- Email
- LinkedIn
- GitHub
- Twitter

Special section for recruiters with:
- What you're looking for
- Technologies you work with
- Link to resume
```

## Step 4: Create Your First Blog Post

Blog posts go in the `_posts` directory with a specific naming convention:
`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

Example: `2025-08-05-how-to-create-github-pages-with-jekyll.md`

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-08-05 10:00:00 -0000
categories: [tutorial, jekyll]
tags: [jekyll, github, tutorial]
excerpt: "Brief description of your post"
---

# Your Post Title

Your post content here using Markdown syntax.
```

## Step 5: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)

If you have Ruby installed, you can test your site locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Start the development server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Visit http://localhost:4000 in your browser
```

## Step 6: Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Commit all your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Jekyll site setup"
git push origin main
```

2. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)"
   - Save

3. Wait a few minutes and visit `https://yourusername.github.io`

## Step 7: Customize and Expand

Now that your basic site is working, you can:

- Customize the CSS in `_sass` directory
- Add custom layouts in `_layouts`
- Create additional pages
- Add a projects section
- Integrate analytics
- Add a comment system

## Best Practices for Blogging

1. **Write regularly**: Consistency helps build an audience
2. **Document your projects**: Share what you're building and learning
3. **Use proper SEO**: Good titles, descriptions, and tags
4. **Include code examples**: Make your posts practical and useful
5. **Proofread**: Professional writing reflects well on you

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now have a professional portfolio site with blogging capabilities. This platform is perfect for:

- Showcasing your projects
- Sharing tutorials and insights
- Building your professional brand
- Connecting with other developers
- Attracting potential employers

The best part? It's completely free and you have full control over the content and design.

## What's Next?
