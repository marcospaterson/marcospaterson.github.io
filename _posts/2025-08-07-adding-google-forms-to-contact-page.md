---

One of the challenges with static Jekyll sites is handling user input - particularly contact forms. While Jekyll excels at serving fast, secure static content, it doesn't have server-side processing for forms. Enter Google Forms: a free, reliable solution that can be seamlessly integrated into your Jekyll contact page.

In this tutorial, I'll show you exactly how I added a fully functional contact form to my Jekyll site using Google Forms, complete with custom styling and responsive design.

## Why Google Forms for Jekyll Sites?

Before diving into implementation, let's understand why Google Forms is an excellent choice for Jekyll contact pages:

### ‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- **Completely free** - No hosting costs or third-party fees
- **No backend required** - Perfect for static sites
- **Spam protection** - Built-in Google security
- **Data management** - Responses automatically organized in Google Sheets
- **Email notifications** - Get notified instantly of new submissions
- **Mobile responsive** - Works perfectly on all devices
- **Easy customization** - Can be styled to match your site

### ‚ùå **Limitations:**
- Google branding (can be minimized with styling)
- Limited design customization compared to custom forms
- Requires Google account

## Step 1: Create Your Google Form

1. **Go to Google Forms**: Visit [forms.google.com](https://forms.google.com)
2. **Create a new form**: Click the "+" button or "Blank form"
3. **Set up your form title**: Something like "Contact Me" or "Get In Touch"

### Essential Form Fields

Here are the fields I recommend for a contact form:

```
üìù Form Title: "Contact Me"
üìã Description: "I'd love to hear from you! Whether you have a question, collaboration idea, or just want to say hello."

üîπ Name (Short answer, Required)
üîπ Email (Short answer, Required, Email validation)
üîπ Subject (Short answer, Required)  
üîπ Message (Paragraph, Required)
üîπ How did you find me? (Multiple choice, Optional)
   - Google Search
   - LinkedIn  
   - GitHub
   - Social Media
   - Referral
   - Other
```

### Setting Up Form Validation

1. **Click on each field** to configure:
   - **Name field**: Toggle "Required" on
   - **Email field**: Toggle "Required" on, then "Advanced" ‚Üí "Response validation" ‚Üí "Email"
   - **Subject field**: Toggle "Required" on
   - **Message field**: Toggle "Required" on

2. **Configure form settings**:
   - Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) at the top
   - **General tab**:
     - ‚úÖ Collect email addresses
     - ‚úÖ Limit to 1 response (if desired)
   - **Presentation tab**:
     - Add a custom confirmation message
     - Show link to submit another response

## Step 2: Get the Embed Code

1. **Click "Send"** at the top of your form
2. **Select the embed option** (< > icon)
3. **Adjust dimensions**: 
   - Width: `780px` (good for most layouts)
   - Height: `920px` (adjust based on your form length)
4. **Copy the iframe code**

Your embed code will look like this:

```html
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true" 
        width="780" 
        height="920" 
        frameborder="0" 
        marginheight="0" 
        marginwidth="0">
  Loading‚Ä¶
</iframe>
```

## Step 3: Integrate into Your Jekyll Contact Page

Here's how I integrated Google Forms into my contact page:

```html
---
layout: default
title: Contact
permalink: /contact/
---

<div class="contact-page">
  
  <!-- Contact Information Section -->
  <section class="contact-methods">
    <h1 class="text-3xl my-2">Where to find me</h1>
    
    <div class="contact-grid">
      <div class="text-start contact-item">
        <p class="text-left">Email: 
          <a href="mailto:your.email@gmail.com">your.email@gmail.com</a>
        </p>

        <p class="text-left mt-2">LinkedIn: 
          <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile" target="_blank">
            linkedin.com/in/yourprofile
          </a>
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-left mt-2">GitHub:
          <a href="https://github.com/yourusername" target="_blank">
            github.com/yourusername
          </a>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Google Form Section -->
  <section class="contact-form">
    <h2>Send me a message</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Use the form below to get in touch. I'll respond as quickly as possible!</p>
    
    <div class="form-container">
      <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true" 
              width="100%" 
              height="920" 
              frameborder="0" 
              marginheight="0" 
              marginwidth="0"
              class="google-form">
        Loading contact form...
      </iframe>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Additional Information Section -->
  <section class="recruiter-info">
    <h2>For Recruiters & Collaborators</h2>
    
    <div class="recruiter-details">
      <h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>

        <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
</div>
```

## Step 4: Add Custom Styling

To make your Google Form blend seamlessly with your site design, add this CSS to your `assets/main.scss`:

```scss
// Contact form styling
.contact-form {
  margin: 3rem 0;
  
  h2 {
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    color: #333;
  }
  
  p {
    text-align: center;
    color: #666;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
  }
}

.form-container {
  background: white;
  border-radius: 12px;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border: 1px solid #e9ecef;
  
  // Responsive iframe container
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 780px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.google-form {
  display: block;
  border: none;
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 920px;
  
  // Remove default iframe styling
  background: transparent;
}

// Responsive adjustments
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .form-container {
    border-radius: 0;
    margin: 0 -1rem;
    box-shadow: none;
    border-left: none;
    border-right: none;
  }
  
  .google-form {
    min-height: 800px;
  }
  
  .contact-form {
    h2 {
      font-size: 1.8rem;
    }
    
    p {
      font-size: 0.9rem;
      padding: 0 1rem;
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Set Up Email Notifications

To get notified when someone submits your form:

1. **Open your Google Form**
2. **Go to "Responses" tab**
3. **Click the three dots menu** (‚ãÆ)
4. **Select "Get email notifications for new responses"**
5. **Enable notifications**

You'll now receive an email every time someone fills out your contact form!

## Step 6: Manage Responses

Google automatically creates a spreadsheet with all form responses:

1. **In your form, go to "Responses" tab**
2. **Click the green spreadsheet icon** to create/view spreadsheet
3. **Access organized data** including:
   - Timestamp
   - All form fields
   - Email addresses (if collected)

### Pro Tips for Response Management:

```bash
üìä **Google Sheets Integration**:
- Automatic data collection
- Export to CSV for analysis  
- Create charts and analytics
- Set up additional email triggers

üîî **Advanced Notifications**:
- Use Google Apps Script for custom notifications
- Forward to specific team members
- Integrate with Slack or Discord
- Set up auto-responses
```

## Advanced Customizations

### Custom Thank You Message

After form submission, users see a default Google message. Customize it:

1. **In form editor, click "Settings"** (‚öôÔ∏è)
2. **Go to "Presentation" tab**
3. **Add custom confirmation message**:

```
Thank you for reaching out! üéâ

I've received your message and will get back to you within 24-48 hours. 

In the meantime, feel free to:
‚Ä¢ Check out my latest projects on GitHub
‚Ä¢ Connect with me on LinkedIn  
‚Ä¢ Follow my blog for updates

Looking forward to our conversation!
- [Your Name]
```

### Conditional Logic (Google Forms Pro)

For more advanced forms, you can add conditional logic:

1. **Add multiple choice or dropdown questions**
2. **Click the three dots** on the question
3. **Select "Go to section based on answer"**
4. **Create different paths** based on responses

Example use case:
```
Question: "What type of inquiry is this?"
- Job Opportunity ‚Üí Go to "Job Details" section
- Collaboration ‚Üí Go to "Project Details" section  
- General Question ‚Üí Go to "Contact Info" section
```

### Styling the Iframe Container

For better responsive behavior and styling:

```css
.responsive-form {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 2rem auto;
  
  &::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: -10px;
    left: -10px;
    right: -10px;
    bottom: -10px;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    border-radius: 20px;
    z-index: -1;
    opacity: 0.1;
  }
}

.form-wrapper {
  background: white;
  border-radius: 15px;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-shadow: 0 20px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  
  iframe {
    border: none;
    width: 100%;
    display: block;
  }
}
```

## Step 7: Testing Your Implementation
